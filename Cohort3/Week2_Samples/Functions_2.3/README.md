### Exercise 2.3
Write a program that will do the following:

<ol>
<li>Compute the kinetic energy for five different individuals.
You may input the values for the individuals or hard-code them.</li>
<li>Store the results for the individuals in some fashion, think list or dictionary.</li>
<li>Print the results that have been stored.</li>
<li>Implement each of the above items in different functions, think modularly.</li>
</ol>

<pre>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>
KE = 1/2 m * v^2 where: KE = kinetic energy(J), m = mass(Kg), v = velocity(m/s)
