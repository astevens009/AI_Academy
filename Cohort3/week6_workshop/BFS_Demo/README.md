### 6.4 Breadth first search:
Write a program that will do the following:

1. Implement breadth first search.
2. Implement a class Node.
3. Node class should have attributes value, and parent.
4. Graph class should **not** inherit the node class.
5. Create a graph object and use the add edge function to create a graph of nodes.  
6. Create at least 5 or 6 nodes.
7. Perform BFS and print the results of BFS.
8. As an added challenge, create a function to keep track of the parents of each node.
9. If you create the function, try printing these parents.
