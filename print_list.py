# Exercise: Assume you have a list of numbers 
# 
#       12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20
#

print()
# 1. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
for num in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    print(num)

print()
# 2. Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.
for num in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    print("{} : {} ".format(num, (num ** 2)))
